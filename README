This is a fork of PorousMultiphaseFoam with multiple modifications to simulate
the Liesegang phenomena. Please refer to www.github.com/phorgue/porousMultiphaseFoam 
for installation instructions and other such things.

Two example study cases are located in the tutorials folder, the first one is 1D and the other one
is 2D. There's also an auxiliary tool to measure the width and spacing law of the
simulated cases in the utilities folder, with installation instructions commented
at the top of its sourcecode.
