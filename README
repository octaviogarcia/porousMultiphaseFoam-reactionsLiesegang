This is a fork of PorousMultiphaseFoam with multiple modifications to simulate
the Liesegang phenomena. Please refer to www.github.com/phorgue/porousMultiphaseFoam 
for installation instructions and other such things.

Two example study cases are located in the /examples/liesegangReaction folder, the first 
one is 1D and the other one is 2D. The simulation results of such examples can be found in 
the following .zip file:

There's also an auxiliary tool to measure the width and spacing law of the simulated 
cases (1D or 2D) in the utilities folder, with installation instructions commented at 
the top of its sourcecode.
